advice_levels_onscreen_text_40000	Aberffro was the capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd from AD 860 until AD 1170. The Royal estates of the Princes of Aberffro were governed from the Llys, or the Royal court, and as Aberffro was the central one, so the palace grew. It was from it that the officials of the princes court sallied forth to gather taxes and rent from the surrounding commotes. In the 10th century, Rhodri the Great had inherited Gwynedd from his father and Powys from his mother, and he added Seisyllwg by a dynastic marriage to Angharad of Seisyllwg. Rhodri's influence in the rest of Wales was significant, and he left a lasting legacy.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40001	Aberteifi was selected at a very early period as an eligible site for commerce given its maritime accessibility with distant parts of the kingdom. The Welsh name Aberteifi (later known as "Ceredig's land") refers to its position by the mouth (aber) of the River Teifi. Ceredig was supposedly one of the sons of Cunedda Wledig, who Welsh legend records invaded from the north to recover lands in Roman Britain from invading Irishmen around early AD 400. Little is known either of its original foundation or of its primitive inhabitants. There are no records of its history prior to the conquest of this part of the country by the Normans.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40002	Achadh Bo contains a large number of Early Christian farmsteads, known as ringforts. Achadh Bo Abbey was founded in the sixth century by St. Canice. The abbey grew into a major centre of learning, commerce and agriculture. It was plundered by the Vikings in 913 and rebuilt in 1052 with relics of St Canice enshrined. It was again burned in 1116 and rebuilt in 1189.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40003	This area is known as the Isle of Aethelingaeg because it was once a very low isolated island in the very great swampy and impassable marshes of the Somersaete Levels. It was to these remote islands that Alfred came in AD 877 to escape from the Danes who threatened to overrun his kingdom. Alfred stayed at Aethelingaeg from the autumn of 877 until the spring of 878 when he had a fortress built. Here Alfred reorganized his forces and prepared to launch an offensive that culminated in his pivotal victory at the Battle of Edington About a decade later, around AD 888 Alfred founded a monastery at Aethelingaeg beside the earlier fort which was dedicated to Our Blessed Saviour, St Peter, St Paul and St Athelwine and was meant to commemorate his victory and give thanks to God.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40004	Inber Nise was one of the chief strongholds of the Picts, and in CE 565 was visited by St Columba with the intention of converting the Pictish king Brude, who is supposed to have resided in the vitrified fort on Craig Phadrig, on the western edge of the city. The strategic location of Inber Nise has led to many conflicts in the area. Reputedly there was a battle in the early 11th century between King Malcolm and Thorfinn of Norway at Blar Nam Feinne, to the southwest of the city.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40005	Ard Macha means "Macha's height" and began as a Ulaid pagan ritual site to the goddess Macha. Macha is associated with the land, fertility, kingship, war and horses. After Christianity spread to Ireland, the pagan sanctuary was converted into a Christian one, and Ard Macha became the site of an important church and monastery. According to tradition, Saint Patrick founded his main church there in the year 457, and it eventually became the "ecclesiastical capital" of Ireland. Saint Patrick was said to have decreed that only those educated in Ard Macha could spread the gospel. In 839 and 869, the monastery in Ard Macha was raided by Vikings. As with similar raids, their goal was to acquire valuables such as silver, which could often be found in churches and monasteries.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40006	The village of Bebbanburg was the seat of the Northumbrian Kingdom for several hundred years. It is dominated by its great sandstone castle which stands on a massive whin sill outcrop, overlooking a beautiful beach and the Farne Islands out at sea. One of the most powerful Northumbrian kings associated with Bebbanburg was King Oswald (AD634-642), a pagan, who converted to Christianity and appointed St Aidan as the first bishop of nearby Lindisfarne, making this north eastern corner of Northumbria an important focal point for early Christian cultural developments. Archaeological excavations at an Anglo-Saxon cemetery just outside Bamburgh Castle have revealed that the Northumbrian capital at Bamburgh was a cosmopolitan community during the time of King Oswald. Dominance of Anglo-Saxon power in the area came to an end when the Vikings conquered Eoferwic in 866. The castle atop the hill was completely destroyed by the Vikings in AD 993.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40007	It is believed that Vikings came to Blascona late in the 8th century. It is not known whether Vikings came as "landtakers", dispossessing indigenous Pict peoples, or whether Viking farmers settled peacefully among the natives of Blascona or some of both. In any case, it appears that the Norse immigrants soon assumed dominance over any communities there. In time, Blascona came to be ruled by jarls established by royal authority from Norway. The raiders used Blascona as a base of operations from which to carry out aggressive raids against the coasts of Scotland as well as their own Norwegian kin.  Harold Hårfagre ("Fair Hair") subdued the rovers in 875 and annexed both Blascona to Norway.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40008	In the 9th century, Vikings invaded Bòrnais and the gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the south, and established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout these lands. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians it was Suðreyjar (meaning southern isles). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that Suðreyjar was not Scottish, and king Edgar quitclaimed any residual doubts. At Kilpheder, the roundhouses were abandoned in favour of Norse longhouses; at Bornish, a few miles to the north, a more substantial Norse settlement was built. As indicated by archaeological finds, residents had access to a wide trading network, stretching throughout the Norwegian empire, as well as adjacent lands like Ireland.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40009	Cair Gwent was at the center of a Welsh kingdom (Guent) between the Rivers Wye and Usk. It was founded by the Romans in AD 75 as Venta Silurum, a market town for the defeated Silures tribe. Some historians hypothesize that Cair Gwent is the Welsh name for Camelot. Thomas Malory wrote that twelve of Arthur's defeated enemies were buried in St. Stephen's church in Camelot, also recording that Arthur and Guinevere were married in this same church. While other historians argue Malory could have confused Caerwent with Caerwynt (the Welsh name for Winchester), it's notable that there exists a known St. Stephen's church in Cair Gwent but not in Winchester.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40010	The Rock of Caisil to which the town below owes its origin is one of the most breathtaking castles in all of Ireland. It sits upon an isolated elevation of stratified limestone that rises abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the Golden Vale. Originally known as Fairy Hill, or Sid-Druim, the Rock was, in pagan times, the dun, or castle, of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic, Caisil denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of several places in Ireland. The "Book of Rights" suggests the name is derived from Cais-il, i.e. "tribute stone", because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. In the 5th century, the Eóganachta dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. Saint Patrick is believed to have baptised Cashel's third king, Aengus. In 977 the Dál gCais usurper, Brian Boru, was crowned here as the first non-Eóghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40011	Cantwaraburg (later Canterbury) began gradually decaying after the Romans left Britain in 410 and was entirely abandoned except for a few farmers. Over the next 100 years, an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls as Jutish refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals. Pope Gregory sent Augustine in 597 to convert its King Æthelberht to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury was chosen by Augustine as the center for his Episcopal See in Kent, thus becoming the first Archbishop of Canterbury. The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint. In 672, the Synod of Hertford gave the See of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church. In 842 and 851, Canterbury suffered great loss of life during Danish raids. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine's Abbey. A second wave of Danish attacks began in 991, and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and Archbishop Alphege was killed in 1012.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40012	Carleol began as a Roman town called Luguvalium but fell mostly into decay in the AD 407 when the Roman civilization ended. The Celts gave Carleol its name. They called it Caer Luel, the fortified place belonging to Luel. St Cuthbert founded a monastery among the ruins of Carleol in 685. For the rest of the first millennium, Carlisle was an important stronghold contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. In 876 the Vikings captured Carleol and sacked it. The monks moved away but some people probably continued to live within the walls of the old Roman town. By the time of the Norman conquest in 1066, Carlisle was part of Scotland. Carleol was rebuilt and revived by the Norman King William Rufus in 1092. He built a wooden castle at Carleol and encouraged people to come and live in Carleol.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40013	Cathair Commain is a triple stone ringfort that lies west of the road connecting Ballyvaughan and Leamaneh Castle. The fort served an important role in the collection of tribute and patronage that was crucial to the working of the small kingdoms. Cathair Commain was also strategically important to the local economy for its ability to process wool and produce many fine clothes as well as metalworking. A once dominant but later defeated and coopted clan like the Ui Chormaic may have used the structure as a location for collecting cattle tribute prior to their delivery to the ultimate recipient, such as the Corcu Modruadh. The abandonment in the 10th century may tie in with the rise of the Dál gCais, who rose to dominance in the Burren around that time. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40014	The city of Ceaster was founded as a fort, known as Deva Victrix, by the Romans in AD 79. In Welsh legend, King Arthur is said to have fought his ninth battle against the Saxon invasion at the "city of the legions" and later St Augustine came to the city to try and subjugate the Welsh bishops to his mission. In 616, Æthelfrith of Northumbria defeated a Welsh army at the Battle of Ceaster and probably established the Anglo-Saxon position in the area from then on. The Anglo-Saxons adopted the native name as the calque Legeceaster, which over time was shortened to Ceaster. A civilian settlement grew around the settlement over time, probably starting as a group of traders and their families who were profiting from trade with the fortress. The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in Britannia built around the same time at Eoferwic and Caerleon which has led to the suggestion that the fortress may have been intended to become the capital of the province rather than Lunden.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40015	Cetretha was originally the center of an ancient British kingdom called Catraeth. In 598 King Aethelfrith's men heavily defeated the native Britons in a great battle at this location. Presumably the last stand of the Northern Welsh, the battle of Cetretha was a disaster for the Britons. They were slain almost to a man, and the kingdoms of Gododdin and Rheged melted away into the shrouds of history. Aethelfrith's power was now beyond dispute and the Celts were forced to accept his rule. Cetretha would always remain an important economic and military centre regardless of who controlled it.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40016	This large market town was established in AD 600 on a crossing of the River Avon and is surrounded by sparsely populated countryside with woodlands. In AD 853, Æthelswith (sister to Alfred the Great) married King Burgred of Mercia at Cippanhamm. Later in Alfred's adult life Cippanhamm found itself again at the centre of events. Though King Alfred had concluded a supposedly ‘firm peace’ with the Viking leader Guthrum at Exanceaster in 877 which required the Danes to remove themselves from the king’s lands, it was clear that they were intent on permanent conquest and settlement, and their withdrawal took them no further than Mercia. Alfred was at Cippanhamm by Christmas. It has been plausibly suggested that the king had followed Guthrum north and made Cippanhamm his forward base of operations, from which he could shadow his enemies and both prevent looting as well as deter the Vikings from returning. If so, it was a disastrous mistake because Guthrum’s forces attacked Cippanhamm on Twelfth Night, inflicting such a major defeat on the king that they were able to begin settlement of Wessex itself, while Alfred was forced to undertake a guerrilla campaign from the Somerset marshes. Nevertheless, by May 878, Alfred had restored his position sufficiently to win a substantial victory at the Battle of Edington, as a result of which, Guthrum’s forces were compelled to withdraw from Cippanhamm to Cirenceaster.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40017	Cluain Mac Nois was founded in 550 AD by Saint Ciaran who erected a small wooden church here as well as some wattle huts with a very small community. Because of its auspicious location at the crossroads of two major traffic routes, this Irish monastery became bigger and more important than any other at the time. By the mid 8th century the site had expanded into a thriving centre of learning and art. The monastic site had a 10 acre settlement area attached to it which housed not only monks, but also lay people. There were traders and crafts people such as metal workers and stone carving workshops that produced High Crosses as well as grave slabs. There were people with all the skills necessary to run a medieval town. A huge farming area was associated with the monastery which may have stretched as far as 15 kilometres either side of the river Shannon and was connected by a bridge. Cluain Mac Nois became a centre for teaching and education and drew scholars from as far afield as Britain and continental Europe. It was a major centre for the production of manuscripts. In fact, Cluain Mac Nois boasted Irelands’ largest settlement outside Dyflin, such was its’ importance. But like nearly all monastic settlements in Ireland, Cluain Mac Nois was plundered on several occasions by invaders, including the Vikings and Anglo-Normans. It then fell into decline from the 13th century onwards.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40018	Colneceaster ("a group of Roman buildings") is the oldest town in all of England. Colneceaster started life as a center of the local Celtic tribe, the Trinovantes. The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD and they built a fort in a piece of high ground in this center about 44 AD. The fort was surrounded by a ditch and an earth rampart with a wooden palisade on top. Town life mostly ended after the Romans left. Most of the buildings in the Roman town were made from timber and would have soon decayed and fell to pieces. During Saxon rule, Lunden was the capital of the Kingdom of Essex although Colneceaster may have been an important local centre for the north of Essex. The isolated raids by Vikings in the first half of the 9th century took a far more serious turn in 865 when a great army of Danes under the command of Ivar the Boneless invaded the Kingdom of East Anglia. In 869 King Edmund of East Anglia was defeated and killed by the Danes and the east of England fell under Danish control. Under a peace treaty between Wessex and the Danes in 879, Colneceaster was incorporated in the Danelaw. The Kings of Wessex waged continual war on the Danes and finally Colneceaster was recaptured by English armies under Edward the Elder in 917.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40019	Corcach was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Corcach achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman settlers founded a trading port. Much like Dyflin, Corcach was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40020	The area of Din Prys was first inhabited by the Selgovae tribe, then the Romans, and then the Britons. Twelve of King Arthur's battles were recorded by Nennius in Historia Brittonum. The Battle of Tribruit (the 10th battle), has been suggested as having possibly been near Din Prys or near the mouth of the river Avon near Bo'ness. After the Roman departure the area around Din Prys has changed hands many times between the Picts, Anglo-Saxons, Scots and Norse culminating in a decisive victory for Gregory, King of Scots at what is now Lochmaben over the native Britons in 890. Its strategic importance at the mouth of the river would constantly highlight its importance as a military conquest.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40021	Dinefwr is one of several Welsh petty kingdoms that emerged in 5th-century based on the former territory of the Demetae. Tradition relates that a castle was first constructed on this site by Rhodri the Great. Dinefwr was subject to extensive raids during the Viking Age between the 8th and 11th centuries, causing social and political instability, and with the Vikings establishing settlements in southern Dinefwr. By the latter part of the 9th century, the rulers of Dinefwr had grown cautious of the influence of the sons of Rhodri the Great, and sought out an alliance and the patronage of Alfred the Great of England. The precise nature of the relationship between King Alfred and the rulers in Wales remains unclear, whether a transitory alliance or a formal mediatisation of the Welsh rulers to the king of England. In about 904, Dinefwr's ruler, Hywel Dda, incorporated Dinefwr into an enlarged realm to be known as Deheubarth, meaning the "south part", and later went on to conquer Powys and Gwynedd. However, both Powys and Gwynedd returned to their native dynasties on Hywel's death in 950. Viking raids upon the Welsh were "relentless", according to Davies, and subsequent rulers were compelled to raise taxes to pay the ransoms for Welsh hostages in 993, and in 999 a Viking raiding party attacked St. David's and killed Morganau, the bishop.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40022	Because of its position, Dofere controls the English Channel and is known as the 'Lock and Key of England'. Julius Caesar tried to land at Dofere during the Roman Invasion of 55 BC and turned it into an important harbor. Later the Romans built two lighthouses on either side of the harbor, one of which still stands. Later in the 5th century the Saxons founded another settlement at Dofere. Then in the 9th century Alfred the Great created a network of fortified settlements across his kingdom called burhs. In the event of a Danish attack all the men in the area could gather in the local burh to fight them. In the 10th century Dofere was made a burh. An earth rampart probably protected it with a wooden palisade on top. But Dofere was more than a fortress. It was also a busy little town with weekly markets. In the 10th century Dofere also had a royal mint.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40023	Doreceaster was founded by the Romans, although the area was inhabited for thousands of years before they arrived -stone age farmers erected the enclosure known as Maumbury Rings. The Romans invaded Southeast England in 43 AD and they quickly subdued the area we now call Dorset. In the 4th century Roman Doreceaster was given stone walls. What happened to Doreceaster after the Romans left is not certain. The town may have been abandoned or there may have been a small number of people living inside the walls, grazing their cattle there and farming fields outside the walls. As time went by people seem to have trickled back into Doreceaster. At some point a market began and slowly Dorchester grew into a town again. One of the first raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790. According to a chronicler, the King's reeve assembled a few men and sped to meet them thinking that they were merchants from another country. When he arrived at their location, he admonished them and instructed that they should be brought to the royal town. The Vikings then slaughtered him and his men.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40024	Drayton  was not mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086. However it probably grew into a little town in the late 11th century or early 12th century. At that time international trade was booming. Drayton was well situated to trade with Europe and it soon became a busy little port. Drayton also became a focal point for the surrounding villages. It grew into a market town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40025	Druim dá Ethiar takes its name from the ridge of high ground on which it is located above the Bonnet river ("Ridge of Two Demons"). Druim dá Ethiar was the capital of Breifne and the seat of the O'Rourkes - the ancient Kings of Brieifne. It was sometime in the 700's that the kings of Ireland began to realise that it might be possible to extend control over the entire island - a concept not previously considered. This gave rise to the term High King and, although nobody could yet legitimally use the term, it did not stop many clans from eyeing it up. The O'Rourkes, along with their fellow clansmen, claimed to be descendants from Brion, a fifth century King of Connacht who was associated with Ui Neill High Kings of Ireland and would thus spend the next 500 years vying for position of high king, all the while weathering yearly raids and invasions from viking invaders.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40026	Dún Att Fort rises proudly from Moine Mhor – the ‘great moss’ – an expanse of bog that carpets the southern end of Kilmartin Glen. It served as a capital stronghold and as an administrative and cultural centre for the Dal Riata and other Gaelic kings in the 500s to 800s AD. Dún Att was a classic 'nuclear' fort consisting of central core, and a series of outer fortified enclousures or courtyards. Dún Att is mentioned twice in early sources. In 683 the Annals of Ulster record: "The siege of Dún At and the siege of Dún Duirn" without further comment on the outcome or participants. In the same chronicle the entry for 736 states: "Aengus son of Fergus, king of the Picts, laid waste the territory of Dál Riata and seized Dún Att and burned Creic and bound in chains two sons of Selbach, i.e. Donngal and Feradach."	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40027	Dún Beccán derives its name from Old Gaelic Dùn Bheccáin ("fort of Beccán"), Beccán being the name of a Norse chieftan. The village of Dún Beccán lies on the east side of the head of Loch Dún Beccán, which bites deeply into the Isle of Skye from the north west, turning the area known as Duirinish into a peninsula. It likely served as an important trading checkpoint and a staging ground for raiders who wanted to penetrate more South from Northern shores. In the 13th century the smaller fort was left to ruin by Clan MacLeod and Dunvegan Castle was erected instead and continued to be an important trading port for the North. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40028	Dùn Cailden ("Fort of the Caledonii") is thought to date back to the sixth century when a monastery was founded beside the River Tay. Dùn Cailden emerged as a centre of Christianity during the 7th Century, when Columba came over from Iona, and much work was carried out by his successors. In the 9th Century, Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín), the first King of Scots, made Dùn Cailden head of the Celtic Church and capital of the newly-formed nation created by the union of the Scots and the Picts. Kenneth I of Scotland is reputed to have brought relics of St Columba from Iona in 849, in order to preserve them from Viking raids, building a new church to replace the existing structures that had been damaged from the raiding parties. One of these relics was the 'Apostles' Stone, an elaborate but badly worn cross-slab; the other, A well-bronze 'Celtic' hand bell.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40029	Dún Foither was originally a Pictish fortress of strategic importance, set on the frontier between north and south Pictland where the Grampian mountains come close to the North Sea. The AD 681 siege happened in the reign of King Bridei, son of Bili, who was attempting to unite the Picts by force against the overlordship of the Angles. Bridei attacked Orkney in AD 682 from his bases north of the River Tay. After Bridei’s death in AD 693 a power struggle, unsurprisingly, ensued in Pictland. His successor, Taran, was expelled only three years later, suggesting he wasn’t very popular. So, the second siege of Dún Foither, may have been part of a bitter Pictish civil war. Over thirty years later Dún Foither was the scene of one of the most important battles of the Dark Ages - one which could be looked upon as the first ever big battle between the Scots and the English, as the British Isles started to split into two major power blocks. In this episode Constantine II (Constantín mac Áed) defied the conquest of Æthelstan, King of Wessex, by surviving a month-long seige at Dún Foither.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40030	Dún Pátraic is one of Ireland's most ancient and historic towns. It takes its name from a dún (fort), which once stood on the hill that dominates the town, Rath Celtair, named after the mythological warrior of Ulster called Celtchar. Saint Patrick was reputedly buried here in 461  together with Saint Brigit and Saint Columba. From the seventh century the dominant power in Ulster was the Dál Fiatach so much so that the title "Rí Uladh" could simultaneously mean "King of Ulster" and "King of the Dál Fiatach". County Down was the ancient centre of the Dál Fiatach lands, and the chief royal site and religious centre of the Dál Fiatach was at Dún Pátraic from where they ruled Ulster for centuries. Dún Pátraic was an administrative seat that was also well known for its textile inudstry.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40031	Dún Sebuirgi was part of a Gaelic overkingdom, Dál Riata, that included parts of western Scotland and northeastern Ireland, on each side of the North Channel. At its height in the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the Dál Riata encompassed roughly what is now Argyll in Scotland and part of County Antrim in the Irish province of Ulster. In the Book of Armagh, published by Sir William Betham, Ulster King at Arms, we are informed that St. Patrick "At Dún Sebuirgi sat upon a rock, which is called St. Patrick's rock to this day, and there he consecrated holy Olcan bishop, whom he himself had educated, and he returned into the plain of Eilne, and erected many other church, which the Coindiri possess."	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40032	Vikings invaded the territory around Dyflin in the 9th century, establishing the Norse Kingdom of Dyflin, the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland. The Viking settlement was on the River Poddle, a tributary of the Liffey, to the East of Christchurch, in the area known as Wood Quay. The Dubh Linn was a lake used by the Vikings to moor their ships and was connected to the Liffey by the Poddle. The Vikings, or Ostmen as they called themselves, ruled Dyflin for almost three centuries, during which time they were expelled in 902 only to return in 917 and famously defeated by the Irish High King Brian Boru at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.  From that date, the Danes were a minor political force in Ireland, firmly opting for a commercial life. Viking rule of Dyflin lasted until 1171 when the city was captured by King Dermot MacMurrough of Leinster, with the aid of Anglo-Norman mercenaries lead by Strongbow.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40033	Earmutha was founded by the Angles and is one of the most important historic ports on the east coast of England. In AD 495, Cerdic, a Saxon Prince and his son, with five ships, entered the port of Yarmouth and named it Cerdric Shore. This Cerdic Shore seems to have been a great sandbank formed along the shore between two branches or channels of the Yare called Havens. In AD 870, Lodbrog the Dane, driven by a sudden tempest from Denmark across the sea, landed at Reedham where the Court of Edmund, King of East Anglia, was then kept. Lodbrog is said to have been received into Court favour but was soon afterwards murdered in a wood by the King's huntsman (Bern) through jealousy. This later led to the imprisonment and execution of Edmund and put an end to the Saxon dynasty in East Anglia, after Hinguar and Hubba, two Danish chieftains, at the head of 20,000 men, had ravished all East Anglia. By the time of the Domesday Book, in 1086, Earmutha had grown into a little town with a population of a few hundred. The Domesday book records Earmutha as having 70 Burgesses, the largest parish church in England was built here in 1101 and a Royal Charter was granted to the town in 1208, resulting in the town wall being built.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40034	At some point before the 7th century AD, the Gododdin ("descendants of the Votadini) built a hillfort known as Din Eidyn or Etin, almost certainly somewhere within the bounds of modern Eidenburg. In AD 638 the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria, shortly thereafter the greater Eidenburg region came under Northumbrian rule. In the following years the Angles extended their influence west and north of Eidenburg but following their defeat at the Battle of Nechtansmere in AD 685 Eidenburg may have come to mark the north west extremity of the Angles' kingdom. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in 710 the Angles fought against the Picts between the rivers Avon and Carron which flow into the River Forth from the south about 20 miles west of Eidenburg. Though not exclusive, Anglian influence predominated from the mid-seventh century to the mid-tenth century, with Eidenburg as a frontier stronghold. In the late ninth century the Danelaw, centred on Eoferwic, was established in the wake of Viking raids on Britain. The northern part of Northumbria was cut off from the rest of England by the Old Norse-speaking Danes, significantly weakening what remained of the kingdom. During the tenth century its northernmost part, which had retained its Brythonic name Lothian, came under the sway of the Kingdom of Scotland. In AD 973 during a royal council at Chester, the English king Edgar the Peaceful formally granted Eidenburg to Kenneth II, King of Scots.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40035	The withdrawal of the Roman legions from York around 410 AD left Eoferwic at the mercy of the Anglo-Saxons. A legend tells that King Arthur recaptured the city for a time from the invaders, but even Arthur could not stem the Saxon tide for long. In the early 7th century Deira and Bernicia combined to make the Kingdom of Northumbria. The Saxons seem to have settled into Roman Eoferwic without changing the city overmuch. They used the Roman grid pattern of streets and refortified the walls. The golden age of Anglo-Saxon Eoferwic came to an abrupt end in the mid 9th century AD. The prosperity of the city made it an obvious target for the Danish Vikings who now poured forth from their homeland in search of plunder. In 866 an invasion force led by Ivar the Boneless captured the city and made the capitol of their new territory in northern England. he Vikings changed the name of the city from the Saxon Eoforwic to a more Danish "Jorvik". Although the name of Jorvik did not survive the Viking period, the Danes left a legacy of street names behind them; the suffix "gate" that attaches to so many York streets (such as Micklegate and Skeldergate) is based on the Viking "gata", meaning simply, "street". The Vikings established a peaceable communiy based on agriculture and trade. Houses were built from wood with wattle infill for the walls. Excavations in the city centre have shown that the Viking houses were set gable-end on to the street, and packed closely together in long, narrow strips. Behind the street frontage were workshops, then yards with wells and rubbish heaps. Some premises may also have maintained warehouses at the rear of the property. The Viking influence lasted less than a century. In AD 954 Eric Bloodaxe was defeated by Eadred, King of Wessex. Eadred forged an alliance between the northern Kingdom of Northumbria and his own domains in the south. The final Norwegian throw of the dice came in 1066, when an invasion led by Harald Hardrada of Norway was defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, just 8 miles from Eoferwic. Three short weeks later, the Battle of Hastings left England in the hands of the Normans.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40036	Exanceaster began as a settlement on a dry ridge ending in a spur overlooking a navigable river teeming with fish, with fertile land nearby. Roman occupiers established a 42-acre 'playing-card' shaped (rectangle with round corners and two short and two long sides) fort named Isca around 55 AD. The presence of the fort built up an unplanned civilian community of natives and the soldiers' families, mostly to the northeast of the fort. This settlement served as the tribal capital of the Dumnonii until sometime in the 7th century when ownership of the land transferred to the Saxons around the time that they defeated British Dumnonians at Peonnum in Somerset in 658. In 876, it was attacked and briefly captured by Danish Vikings. Alfred the Great drove them out the next summer. Over the next few years, he elevated Exanceaster to one of the four burhs in Devon, rebuilding its walls on the Roman lines. These permitted the city to fend off another attack and siege by the Danes in 893.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40037	Gipeswic is one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon towns in England and has a rich heritage and proud history. Gipeswic started in as a small trading settlement in the early 7th century. There are 2 theories about how Ipswich got its name. It may have been "Gippa's wic" (wic is an old word meaning port). Or it may have been "Gip's wic" (gip meant corner in this case the corner of the river Orwell). Whichever is true Gipeswic soon became a flourishing town. It was ideally situated to trade with Germany. Whetstones and millstones were imported from Germany into Gipeswic. Wool was exported. In Anglo-Saxon Gipeswic there were many weavers of wool. There were also potters and many other craftsmen. Gipeswic also had a mint. However because of its position in the East of England Gipeswic was vulnerable to attack by the Danes. The Danes occupied Gipeswic from 869 until 917 when it was recaptured by the English.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40038	Gleawceaster owes its name, strategic location and much of its layout to many centuries of Roman occupation. The first settlement was a military fortress at Kingsholm established in the late 40s or early 50s AD. It developed into one of the chief settlements in Roman Britain, and was granted the title of Colonia Nervia Glevensis by Emperor Nerva – the highest status a provincial town could achieve in the Roman Empire. After the Fall of Rome, Gleawceaster was captured by the Saxons following the decisive battle Dyrham in 577. The Mercian king, Osric of Hwicce, founded an abbey dedicated to St Peter. By the tenth century, Gloucester continued to be an important centre in the Kingdom of Mercia, and was famously re-planned and re-fortified by Queen Aethelflaed (daughter of Alfred the Great) as a defense against the marauding Danes. The core street layout survives to this day. Aethelflaed also founded the New Minster church of St Oswald which became a shrine of great importance following the installation the seventh century king and saint’s bones.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40039	In the bronze age and the iron age there were settlements on the site of Grantabrycg. Then in the 1st century AD the Romans built a fort on Castle Hill. However this fort was abandoned at the beginning of the 5th century AD as the Roman Empire declined. Grantabrycg was founded in 875 when the Danes conquered Eastern England. They created a fortified town called a burgh (from which we derive our word borough) on the site. Grantabrycg would have been surrounded by a ditch and an earth rampart probably with a wooden palisade on top. In the 10th century Grantabrycg was captured by the Saxons. However in 1010 Grantabrycg was burned by the Danes. That was an easy task when all the buildings were of wood with thatched roofs. On the other hand if Cambridge was burned it could be easily rebuilt. By the 10th century Grantabrycg was flourishing and it had a mint. It was also the administrative center for the area and so it was a town of some importance, although it would seem tiny to us. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 Grantabrycg probably had a population of about 2,000. By the standards of the time it was a medium sized town. Later in the Middle Ages the population of Grantabrycg probably rose to about 3,000.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40040	The Stone Fort of Grianán of Aileach is sits on a hilltop in Inishowen County Donegal. The origins of the Grianán of Aileach fort are dated back to BC 1700. The Tuatha de Danann invaded Ireland before the Celts and built stone forts on top of strategic hills. They worshipped Dagda (the Good God) and he too is associated with the origins of Aileach. It was he who ordered the building of a stone fort to act as a burial monument to his dead son. The round fort is built largely without mortar. The interior has three terraces and wooden structures were built against the terraces to provide accommodation. The outline of Bronze Age or Iron Age ramparts can be seen below the fort. Legend states that the giants of Inishowen are lying sleeping but when the sacred sword is removed they will spring to life reclaiming their ancient lands. Unsurprisingly, given its age, the site is also very woven into local folklore. A well just beyond the fortress walls supplied water to the nearby villagers and was believed to have magical properties, a reputation which may have developed from its history with St. Patrick, who is said to have baptized the local chieftain here in 450. Superstition also warned not to tell a secret within the cashel walls, or everyone would find out. This may have stemmed from the fort’s acoustically amplifying shape.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40041	Guvan originated as part of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde where the local language was a form of Cymro-Celtic, related to modern-day Welsh. The terms "Gov, Govan, Govant" were all used to designate an artist or a smith who prepared metal from raw ore. It has been suggested that the workshops of the early Christian artisans may have given its name to both the village and the parish. According to legend, the site was founded by St. Constantine who brought Christianity to the area when he founded a monastic settlement around the year AD 565. The best known tradition about this saint is that he was a pagan King of Cornwall who abdicated after murdering his 2 sons in a fit of insanity. Constantine then became a Christian convert and travelled to Wales where he began a new life as a working monk under David, the future patron saint of Wales. After spending some years in Wales, Constantine moved to Ireland where he joined a monastery under the charge of St. Columba. He ordained Constantine into the Holy Orders of the priesthood, and also suggested to him that he should try and spread Christianity among the heathen Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Constantine crossed the Irish Sea and eventually found his way to the south bank of the River Clyde where he established his Celtic Church on its present day site, and where he was later appointed as the Abbot of Guvan. When Constantine was an old man, he prayed that he might die as a martyr to the Church for his past sins. His prayers were answered when some pagans attacked him and cut off his arm while he was trying to preach to them in Kintyre. Constantine died from his wounds there in 576 and his followers brought his body back to Guvan where they buried him in front of the High Altar of the Church. Whoever was the true founder of the church, from the date of his death in the 6th century, Guvan became a place of pilgrimage.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40042	Sometimes in the 7th century after Angle occupation Gyruum became a center of learning and had the largest library north of the Alps, primarily due to the widespread travels of Benedict Biscop, its founder. In 794 Jarrow became the second target in England of the Vikings, who had plundered Lindisfarne in 793. In the 8th century, the monastery of Saint Paul in Gyruum was the home of Bede, who is regarded as the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholar and the father of English history. A much under publicised fact is that the world's oldest complete Bible, written in Latin and to be presented to the then Pope (Gregory II) was produced at this monastery – 'the Codex Amiatinus' – which is currently safeguarded in the Laurentian Library, Florence, Italy. Originally three copies of the Bible were commissioned by Saint Ceolfrid in 692. This date has been established as the double monastery of Wearmouth-Gyruum secured a grant of additional land to raise the 2000 head of cattle needed to produce the vellum for the Bible's pages. Saint Ceolfrid accompanied one copy (originally intended for Gregory I) on its journey to be presented to Gregory II, but he died en route to Rome.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40043	The name "Haestingas" derives from the Old English tribal name, "the people of the Hastings tribe." In AD 771 King Offa of Mercia invaded Southern England, and over the next decade gradually seized control of Sussex and Kent. Symeon of Durham records a battle fought at an unidentified location near the town in 771, at which Offa defeated the Haestingas tribe, effectively ending its existence as a separate kingdom. By 790, Offa controlled Hastings effectively enough to confirm grants of land in Hastings to the Abbey of St Denis, in Paris. But, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 1011 relates that Vikings overran "all Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Haestingas", indicating the town was still considered a separate 'county' or province to its neighbours 240 years after Offa's conquest. During the reign of Athelstan, he established a royal mint in Hastings in AD 928. The start of the Norman Conquest was the Battle of Hastings in which William the Conqueror defeated and killed Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon King of England. With the Saxon Army destroyed, William was free to march on Lunden, thus opening the rest of England to Norman conquest.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40044	Hylmrekr was established by the Vikings on an island on the River Shannon in AD 922.  In that year a Viking jarl or prince called Tomrair mac Ailchi—Thórir Helgason—led the Hylmrekr fleet on raids along the River Shannon, from the lake of Lough Derg to the lake of Lough Ree, pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. Two years later, the Dyflin vikings led by Gofraid ua Ímair attacked Hylmrekr, but were driven off. The war between Dyflin and Hylmrekr continued until 937 when the Dyfliners, now led by Gofraid's son Amlaíb, captured Hylmrekr's king Amlaíb Cenncairech and for some reason destroyed his fleet. However, no battle is actually recorded and so a traditional interpretation has been that Amlaíb mac Gofraid was actually recruiting Amlaíb of Hylmrekr for his upcoming conflict with Athelstan of England, which would turn out be the famous Battle of Brunanburh. The 920s and 930s are regarded as the height of Norse power in Ireland and only Hylmrekr rivalled Dyflin during this time. The last Norse king of the city was Ivar of Hylmrekr, who features prominently as an enemy of Mathgamain mac Cennétig.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_40046	The island of Ioua, off the west coast of Scotland, is the symbolic centre of Scottish Christianity. Thanks to the fame of its monastic founder, St Columba, the island has always been revered as a holy place, and, over the centuries, Ioua has continually been re-invented and reconstructed as a centre for pilgrimage. Ioua's fame began in AD 563 when Columba, with thirteen followers, landed at the south end of the island, at St Columba's Bay, to establish the first monastery which would become a centre of pilgrimage. Columba died on the 9th June 597 AD. Adomnán writes that his final day was spent copying a psalter, on the Torr An Alba (the Hill of Scotland). He urged his successor as abbot to take up his work, then went to the church, dying in prayer before the altar with a final gesture of blessing on his monks. The pilgrims travelled to Ioua in life and in death. Many of the kings of Scotland, Ireland, and even of the Vikings, were buried there. Some of the most famous Kings of Alba, from Kenneth MacAlpin to MacBeth, made their final journey there - across the sound to Ioua, onto the harbour, and up the Street of the Dead to the burial ground, the Relig Oran. Wealthy pilgrims brought money to the monastery, and in the 8th century some of the finest medieval works of art were created to glorify Columba. The Book of Kells was crafted on Ioua, along with the celtic high crosses from the 8th and 9th centuries - dedicated to St Martin, St Odhrain, St John and St Matthew. The crosses are of exquisite celtic design and were given by wealthy patrons to promote the Cult of Columba.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40047	Lindcylne was first built up by La Tène Celts in BC 500, later invaded, occupied, and became and important industrial centre to the Romans in AD 70. Incoming groups of Angles settled in the Midland and East Midland areas of what eventually became the Kingdom of Lindsey during the 6th century. It appeared to have maintained its independence until at least the end of the 7th century, but was absorbed by Mercia in the 8th century. In 865 a formidable Danish raiding army, led by Ivar the Bonless, one of the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok, landed in East Anglia and established winter quarters there. Within a few years, this force succeeded in conquering Mercia and all the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except Wessex. Scandinavian settlers followed the raiders into the swathe of England under Danish control, which became known as the Danelaw. They have left a legacy of Scandinavian elements in many Lincolnshire place-names. Lindcylne became a Danish borough. In the 10th century, it was designated as the head of the new shire of Lincolnshire.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40048	The River Aire meanders its way south-eastwards across Yorkshire and eventually joins the Humber and the North Sea. In prehistoric times it flowed through a heavily wooded and swampy valley and it is here, at a ford over the river, that the village of Loidis was established. Other villages such as Armley, Bramley, Headingley and Hunslet grew up on the rolling hills around it. However, it was Loidis, at that vital river crossing, which came to dominate the surrounding out-townships, gradually absorb them and ultimately become a major European city. About AD 730, the Venerable Bede, writing his classic 'History of the English Church and People', refers to Loidis, by which he meant the town and surrounding area of Loidis. He also went on to tell how the pagan king, Penda, was killed at the battle of Winwaed 'in the region of Loidis.' The coming of the Vikings saw Yorkshire divided into thirdings or 'ridings.' These were subdivided into wapentakes where the local assembly met. The villages south of the Aire; Armley, Beeston, Farnley, Hunslet and the rest were part of the Morley wapentake. Those to the north, like Loidis and Cookridge, were in the Skyrack wapentake which met at the old oak tree in Headingley. It has been suggested that a Viking settlement was established at Giant's Hill, Armley, but no archaeological evidence is available to support this. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40049	At its height of Roman rule in the 2nd century, Roman Lunden had a population of around 60,000. With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, Lunden ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed. After Alfred defeated Guthrum in 878, the new boundaries for Danelaw were established, stretching roughly from Lunden to Chester. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred "refounded" Lunden in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. Lunden then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically. By the 11th century, Lunden was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, Lunden became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital."	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40050	Maeldune is a maritime and market town in the County of Essex situated on the Blackwater estuary. "Maeldune" is the Saxon spelling of the Roman Maldon and means "a cross on the hill". There was a late Roman port here, on low ground on the south bank of the River Blackwater, but the main settlement grew further up the hill, where around AD 914 King Edward the Elder built a fortified town, or burh. Most people know Maeldune as the site of a famous battle between the Saxons and Danes, but actually there were two battles here. Around AD 917 the inhabitants resisted an attack by a force of invading Danes, keeping the area safe from Viking invaders for a time, but that safety was not not last. The (Second) Battle of Maeldune is known to history for one major event, for it was here in about AD 991 that a band of invading Danes landed on Northey Island, bent on plunder. Opposing them on the shore were the Saxon inhabitants, led by a warrior called Brythnoth. The Danes could only reach land via a tidal causeway joining Northey Island to the mainland, so it would seem that the Saxons had the upper hand. What happened next is a matter of conjecture, but one version is that Brythnoth allowed the Danes to cross the causeway before giving battle, moved by chivalry. If that was his laudable intent, it backfired badly, for the Danes inflicted a heavy defeat on the Saxons. Rather than simply plundering the area, the Danes and used their victory to launch a concerted program of settlement, seizing land and making the east of England a Viking kingdom.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40051	Mameceaster began when a wooden fort was built by the Roman army on a plateau about AD 80. The Romans called it Mamucium (breast shaped hill) probably because the plateau resembled a breast. However in AD 407 the Roman army left Britain and the civilian settlement disappeared. The stone fort at Manchester fell into ruins. Christianity came to Mameceaster at the beginning of the seventh century after Edwin, King of Northumberland was baptised in Eoferwic in 627, the origins of Mameceaster’s first church could well have been around this time and might have been built on the site of the Saxon summer camp at the confluence of the Irk and the Irwells. The first Danish ships arrived on the East Coast of Northern England in 787 AD and Mameceaster may well have been a place of refuge for people fleeing South. Soon the Vikings were establishing forts along the West Coast and on the river systems. When or if they reached Mameceaster is uncertain though one source claims that around AD 870 the town had been destroyed as the Danes took control of the kingdom of Northumbria capturing York around AD 866 and installing a puppet king and heading south to attack the Kingdom of Mercia below the Mersey. In 919 the West Saxon king Edward the Elder sent a force to repair the Roman site as a defense against the Norsemen, and some traces of this reoccupation have been discovered. By then, however, the growth of Mameceaster had recommenced almost a mile from the fort.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40052	Mathrafal is the original capital of the Kingdom of Powys and was the seat of the Kingdom probably from the 9th century until its destruction in 1212. Wales, like England, was a land of multiple kingships. The rugged terrain, with impenetrable mountain massifs and inhospitable upland ranges, broken by river valleys, did not make for a unified control or a unified development. The boundary with England was not marked by natural defences, and productive lowland areas as well as profitable upland pastures were open to frequent attacks. Not until Offa of Mercia built his dyke in the second half of the 8th century was there a definable frontier, and that was designed mainly to deter Welsh attacks and control trade across the new border. In the ninth century the political order which had emerged among the peoples west of Offa's Dyke broke down. The ruling Dynasty of Dyfed-Deheubarth ran out in 814, that of Gwynedd in 825, and of Powys in 855. Into the vacuum stepped a new breed, the High Kings of all Wales. The first of them took over all Wales outside Glywysing by 878; he fought Vikings and English and although he was cut down in battle, he set a precedent and created a dynasty, grounded in Gwynedd, which took all Wales as its patrimony. He was Rhodri Mawr, the only king in Welsh history called Great. The second set up the dynasty in Dyfed-Deheubarth and by 950 ruled all Wales outside Morgannwg. He presided over a great codification of the laws of Wales, which henceforth bore his name. One Wales was to have one law. He was Hywel Dda the only king in Welsh history to be called good.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_40054	Northhamtun began as a Saxon village. It was called Hamm tun, which means the village by the well-watered meadow. Later it was called North Hamm tun, probably to distinguish it from Southampton. When they occupied Eastern England in the late 9th century the Danes turned Northhamtun into a stronghold called a burh. They dug a ditch around the settlement and erected an earth rampart with a wooden palisade on top. However Northhamtun was not just a stronghold it was also a place of trade where craftsmen worked and where goods were bought and sold at a market. Despite the fact that it was a fortified settlement Northhamtun was captured by the English under the Wessex king Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, in 917. Northhamtun was conquered again in 940, this time by the Vikings of Eoferwic, who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942. Consequently, it is one of the few counties in England to have both Saxon and Danish town-names and settlements. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40055	Northwic (wic is an old word for port and Norwich was an inland port) started as a small Anglo-Saxon settlement north of the river Wensum in Norfolk. In time it grew into a town, perhaps because of its situation on a river as it was much cheaper and easier to transport goods for sale by water than by land. The name Northwic first appears on a coin minted in the early 10th century. By then Northwic was a large and important town. It had a mint and would have had a weekly market. Northwic was probably also a burgh or fortified settlement. The town would have been surrounded by a ditch and earth embankment with a wooden palisade on top. In the 10th century Northwic grew rapidly. As the town grew the settlement spread to the south bank of the river. Gradually the settlement at Northwic shifted from north to south of the river Wensum. Then in 1004 the Danes sacked and burned Northwic. However Northwic was soon rebuilt and flourished once again. The Danes left many place names in this part of England. The street name 'gate', as in Pottergate, is derived from the Danish word gata meaning street. Potter gata was the street where potters lived and worked. The meaning of Fishergate is obvious. The street name Tombland is derived from a Danish word meaning empty space. Fingelgate comes from a Danish word meaning bend or elbow.	true

The Domesday Book states that there were 50 huts in Otergimele, housing a population of 200. The population was scattered thinly across the region and it was at the North-East end of Otergimele (present day Crossens) where blown sand gave way to new fish supplies from the River Ribble Estury that a small concentration of people had occurred. The alluvium provided fertile agricultural land. It was here that a primitive church was built, which gave the emerging village its name of Churchtown, the parish being North Meols (pronounced "meals", not "mells").

Most notably Queen Medb was the warrior queen of Connacht, the western province of Ireland.  It is said that her father was king of Connacht before becoming High King of Ireland and she became ruler of Connacht after him.  She had five recognised husbands, and ruled for over 60 years.  She was also said to be the reason her husbands became kings, that to be the ruler of Connacht they had to be 'married to Medb' as in married to the land. The first mention of Medb is in the Cave of Cruachan, Oweynagat, in the form of an Ogham inscription on the lintel stone placed in the cave during the 4th or 5th century CE.

Indeed, the very name of the village hints at its Anglo-Saxon heritage, for the word Rendlesham is thought to come from a combination of words meaning 'place of the shield'. Raedwald, a descendant of the first King of the East Angles, reigned from roughly AD 599–624. He was a Christian, but his wife was a pagan, so he came up with an ingenious solution.

Aethelberht walled it in 600AD, and founded a missionary church, which became the nucleus of the cathedral. From its situation as the most accustomed passage over the river Medway, Rofesceaster has been subject to more misfortunes than perhaps any other city whatsoever. In 676, Ethelred, king of Mercia, having invaded Cent, destroyed this city, and returned with great plunder to his own kingdom. During the Danish wars in England, Rofesceaster frequently suffered from the inhumanity of those barbarians, this city being often besieged and plundered by them, the enemy in general committing unheard-of cruelties before they returned to their ships. Terrified and worn down by its misfortunes, this city at length made no further opposition against them, but submitted with the rest of the nation to the yoke of these invaders, in which state it continued, without any particular circumstances happening to it, till the Norman conquests in 1066.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40060	Scoan was traditionally the capital of a Pictish kingdom. Thus there may have been a village, a religious centre, or even seat of power based at Scoan from as early as even the 5th century with Scoan coming into real and recorded prominence in the 9th century during the amalgamation of the Pictish and Gaelic peoples and kingdoms. Scoan at this point played a crucial role in the formation and governance of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland. It was in these years in the 9th century that Kenneth MacAlpin came east to Scoan bringing with him a holy relic and coronation stone which being housed at Scoan acquired the name, the Stone of Scone over time. Although it sounds like a stale tea time pastry, the Stone of Scoan is a powerful symbol of Scottish sovereignty. According to legend, the sandstone slab was used by the biblical figure Jacob as a pillow when he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven and was then brought to Scotland by way of Egypt, Spain and Ireland. The rock, also known as the Stone of Destiny, was used for centuries in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs.	true

In 869, as the Winchester Chronicle testifies, these hardy warriors occupied the town, and were besieged by Alfred and Aethelred. A treaty of peace was temporarily concluded, but in the spring of 874 they returned in ever-increasing numbers, conquered Mercia, and occupied the five boroughs of Snotingaham, Lindcylne, Steanford, Deoraby, and Leicester. Here they remained until Edward the Elder, assisted. by his sister, Aethelflaed, drove them away, Edward’s capture of Nottingham in 919 being, in the words of Mr. Freeman, ‘the crown of his conquests in Central England.’ Edward built a fortress on the southern bank of the Trent in 921, and connected it with the town by a bridge, where his successor, Aethelstan, established a mint, and coins of his, bearing the Snotingaham mark, have been found. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40063	When the Roman Legions withdrew from Britain in AD 410, local leaders invited groups of Saxons to settle in Steanford as a counter force against invaders. However, these supposed protectors rebelled against the locals and instead undertook a period of invasion and settlement. From the 5th to the 6th century A.D., these invaders soon became settlers and farmers, and developed a farming system based on a manor and two or three open fields. The Anglo-Saxons were good water engineers, and knew how to grind corn with water mills; it was around the nucleus of the manor, mills, and, later, the church, that Saxon Steanford grew. By the 8th-9th centuries, the Vale was being run systematically by large estates granted by the Crown to nobles and the Church. The area was again threatened by war as Viking war bands raided further into Wessex, but towards the end of Alfred's reign (871-899) the position improved with the introduction of the Danelaw, and a peace of sorts returned to the Vale. Christianity arrived in the Upper Thames area in about 635, when St. Birinus became Bishop of Dorchester. In Steanford, a simple Saxon church (most likely of timber and thatch construction) was built in the 10th Century, adjacent to the early manor house (underlying the present one). Both the Saxon manor house (mott) and church were surrounded by a defensive ditch. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40064	About 70 AD the Romans built a town on a bend in the River Itchen, where Bitterne now stands. The Saxon king, Ine, built Suthhamtun on the other side of the Itchen about 690-700 AD. Saxon Suthhamtun was a large and important port. It is estimated that the population of the Saxon town was 4,000-5,000, which was very large for its time. Saxon Suthhamtun was laid out with streets on a grid pattern like the old Roman town, but all the buildings in it were of wood. In the town craftsmen made things like needles and combs from animal bone. There were also blacksmiths, bronze smiths, carpenters, thatchers, leather workers and potters. Women wove wool into cloth. The main export from Suthhamtun was wool. Wine and fine pottery were imported as well as millstones. By the 9th century there was a royal mint in the town. Suthhamtun suffered severely in the Danish raids of the 9th and 10th centuries. The Danes sacked the town several times. Late in the 9th century King Alfred created a network of strongholds called burghs across his kingdom. In the event of a Danish raid all the men in the area were supposed to gather in the stronghold or burgh. In the 10th century Suthhamtun went into decline. This may have been partly due to the Danish raids but it was probably also due to the silting up of the Itchen. As Suthhamtun declined many people probably moved to Wintanceaster but at least some moved to a new settlement beside the Test. This new settlement was also called Hamtun but it was much smaller than the old town. At the time of Domesday (1086) it may have had about 1,000 inhabitants.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40065	Following the end of Roman rule, Anglo-Saxons settlers from northern Germany and Jutland established themselves in "an open meadow by the Tame" which they called "Tomworðig". Tamworthige was initially not much more than a fortified manor. The settlement straddled the River Anker and contained a "large hall for public gatherings" as well as individual homes and agricultural buildings such as stables and granaries. The Tamworthige settlers quickly became wealthy and Tamworthige was thus able to be fortified further. In the reign of King Offa it was the capital of Mercia, the largest of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It was by far the largest town in the English Midlands when today's much larger city of Birmingham was still in its infancy. This is largely due to its strategic position at the meeting point of the rivers Tame and Anker, placing the town perfectly as a centre of trade and industry. The town was sacked by the Danes in 874. It remained a ruin until 913, when Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred the Great and Lady of the Mercians, rebuilt the town and constructed a burh to defend it against further Danish invaders. She made Tamworthige her principal residence and died there in 918. In Tamworthige church in 926, a sister of King Æthelstan, perhaps Saint Edith of Polesworth, was married to Sitric Cáech, the squint-eyed Norse King of York and Dublin.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40066	Tintagol (Cornish meaning "village on a mountain") is a village situated on the Atlantic coast in Cerneu (later Cornwall). Standing proud half on the mainland and half on a jagged headland projecting into the Cornish sea, Tintagol Castle is one of the most spectacular historic sites in Britain. History and legend are inseparable at Tintagol. It was an important stronghold, and probably a residence of rulers of Cornwall during 5th and 7th centuries AD, as indicated by the many fragments of luxury pottery that were left behind by those who lived here. It was probably memories of this seat of Cornish kings that inspired the 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth to name it in his 'History of the Kings of Britain' as the place where King Arthur was conceived, with the help of Merlin. Beneath the castle by the water's edge is a 100 metres long cave formed by erosion. Tennyson made this place famous when he described waves bringing the infant Arthur to the shore, where he was plucked out by Merlin and carried to safety.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40067	Tor in Duine has an ancient history. From the 300s the area became an important centre for the people referred to by the Romans as the Verturiones, who went on to establish the Pictish Kingdom of Fortriu: with, very probably, Tor in Duine as its Northern capital. Over the next 500 years what evolved here was a large fortress, covering an area of three hectares or 7.5 acres. This made it three times the size of any other centre of power in Early Historic Scotland. In 884 Tor in Duine was captured by Sigurd the Powerful, the Norse Earl of Orkney. The indications are that Sigurd rebuilt the fortress and it then became a centre of Norse power in Moray. Under the Norse the fortress became known by the Danish name Burghe, which much later became Burghe-head. The Norse were eventually expelled from this part of the country by the Scots in 1010.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40068	The inhabitants of Vedrafjordr in pre-Danish times were a pastoral people moving from place to place with their flocks or else given to hunting. They did not build towns and they certainly did not build seaports, and it was as a seaport that Vedrafjordr had its true beginning. The Ostmen (Danes) persuaded by the rigours of their own inhospitable clime, had taken to the high seas in search of plunder. During the first half of the 9th century the shores of south-east Ireland were ravaged time after time by Danish expeditions, Ardmore and Lismore being the subjects of a number of raids. At the outset, these bellicose incursions took place only during the summer months, the raiders returning home with their spoils at the onset of winter, but later the Vikings built a permanent encampment. A number of factors influenced the choice of the site. The place provided a splendid anchorage. It was the lowest point at which the river could at that time be forded. Above all, the site could easily be defended. It was protected on three sides by water; in front by the Suir; on the east and at rear by St. John's River and the marshes flanking it. St. John's River did not then, as now, flow neatly between regular banks. Rather, its tortuous and uncontained stream meandered over much of the ground turning thr entire area into viscous marshland. These marshes also extended westwards round the back of the site of the old town. Only on the west itself were substantial fortifications necessary. This was Vedrafjordr in its infancy, a Danish stronghold, subject to constant harassment by the Irish outside the walls, who broke in on more than one occasion to lay waste the foreign colony. During the late 10th and early 11th centuries, the rise of Brian Bóruma saw Vedrafjordr and a number of other Viking ports being brought firmly under the control of the O'Brien dynasty. Control of these Viking ports was significant for would-be Irish High Kings as it granted greater access to international trade and manpower.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40069	The town was founded by the Vikings in about 800 AD. They named it Veisafjǫrðr, meaning "inlet of the mud flats", and the name has changed only slightly into its present form. "Veisa" in modern Norwegian means "Way". So 'Veisafjǫrðr' could have meant "inlet of the way" or "Way Fjord". According to a story recorded in the Dindsenchas, the name "Loch Garman" comes from a man named Garman mac Bomma Licce who was chased to the river mouth and drowned as a consequence of stealing the queen's crown from Temair during the feast of Samhain. For about three hundred years it was a Viking town, a city state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish kings of Leinster. However, in May 1169 Veisafjǫrðr was besieged by Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster and his Norman ally, Robert Fitz-Stephen. The Norse inhabitants resisted fiercely, until the Bishop of Ferns persuaded them to accept a settlement with Dermot.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40070	Waerincwicum began as a Saxon settlement. The name is derived from two Saxon words, wering, which meant weir and wic, which meant houses or settlement. So it was wering wic the settlement by the weir. In the 10th century Waerincwicum was made into a fortified town or burh. The Saxons created a network of fortified settlements called burhs across their kingdom. In the event of a Danish attack all the men from the area could gather together in the local burh. A ditch and a wall protected Saxon Warwick. However Waerincwicum was more than a fortress. It also had weekly markets and a mint. Saxon Waerincwicum was a flourishing little town. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 Waerincwicum probably had a population of about 1,500. By the standards of the time Medieval Waerincwicum was a fair sized market town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40071	Fifteen hundred years ago the Celts lived in the area of Werham, however the modern settlement was founded by the Saxons. They conquered East Dorset in the mid-7th century and about 700 AD a Saxon named St Aldhelm founded a nunnery on the site of Werham. He also built a church (St Martins), which was rebuilt in the early 11th century. In time a village grew up by the nunnery. It was called 'wer ham', the settlement by the weir. In 876 Werham was captured by an army of Danes. Alfred the Great arrived with a Saxon army and made a treaty, temporarily convincing the Danes to withdraw. During Alfred's military reforms Werham was made into a burh. In the event of a Danish attack all the men would gather in the local burh to fight. . It was surrounded by an earth bank with a wooden stockade on top. The Saxon earth bank still survives. However Werham was more than just a fort. It was also a flourishing little market town (part of the Saxon street pattern survives). It also contained a royal mint, showing it was quite an important place. Edward the Martyr, a Saxon king who died in 978 was buried in St Mary's church in Werham	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40072	Wintanceaster began in 70 AD as a Roman regional capital, named "Venta Belgarum" ("the capital of the Belgares", taken from the native Celts). Roman Wintanceaster was built with its streets laid out in a grid pattern. In the middle of the town was the forum. This was a market place lined with shops, temples for worship and public buildings. Roman citizens also went to the baths not just to get clean but also to socialize. At first the buildings in Wintanceaster were made of wood but by the third century some were replaced with brick and stone. Wealthy people lived in splendid houses with glass windows, mosaic floors and walls painted with murals, whereas the poor lived in simple wooden houses. At first the city was protected by ditch and an earth rampart, probably with a wooden palisade on top and was given stone walls later in the 3rd century There were also suburbs outside the walls. Like other Roman towns, Wintanceaster declined in the 4th century. Amid the Saxon invasions of Britain, cemeteries dating to the 6th and 7th centuries suggest a revival of settlement. The city became formally known as "Wintan-ceaster" ("Fort Venta") in Old English. In 648, King Cenwalh of Wessex erected the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, later known as the Old Minster. This became a cathedral in the 660's when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from Dorchester-on-Thames. The present form of the city dates to reconstruction in the late 9th century, when king Alfred the Great obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defense against the Vikings. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.	true
